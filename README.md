# AI for Livestock Emission Tracking

## 📌 Overview

AI for Livestock Emission Tracking is an artificial intelligence–driven system designed to monitor, estimate, and analyze greenhouse gas emissions produced by livestock. The project focuses on improving sustainability in agriculture by providing data-driven insights into methane and carbon emissions.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Track livestock-related greenhouse gas emissions
* Predict emission levels using AI models
* Support sustainable farming and climate-smart agriculture
* Enable data-driven policy and farm-level decisions

## 🧠 Key Features

* Synthetic livestock and emission dataset generation
* Machine learning–based emission prediction
* Data visualization and trend analysis
* Scalable and adaptable for real-world datasets

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas & NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook
